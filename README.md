# Taskit Frontend

This application is a modular android task management applications that has API support for both Canvas LMS and Google Classroom (work in progress). TaskIt uses web-based functionality such as SQL databases, RESTful APIs and server-side scripting to make its features possible.

## Features

### Modulation

The basis of this application is centered around its modular components. Rather than having users manually enter all of their task from their learning management systems (such as Canvas or Google Classroom), TaskIt allows them to enter login cridentials, pulls the data it needs, and creates tasks for the users. The users are able to add as many accounts as they need and will be able to modify identifiers for the accounts (such as names, colors and pointers).

### Scalability

TaskIt's backend is centered around a hosted MySQL database and a set of APIs for specific functions. With the use of each API, one can fully integrate their TaskIt data wherever required.

This scalability also allows me to extend this application past an android application and into a web-application (work in progress) quickly and easily, with the only hurdle being the creation of a new user interface.

### Intuitiveness
